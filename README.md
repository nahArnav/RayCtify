## 🔭 Overview

Modern financial AI systems routinely encode demographic bias — not through overt discrimination, but through **proxy variables**: features that silently correlate with race, gender, or national origin. RayCtify was engineered to break that chain.

RayCtify is a **full-scale Algorithmic Equilibrium Suite** that wraps black-box machine learning models in a transparent *Glass Box* proxy. It forces your loan approval AI to evaluate applicants based exclusively on standardized, legally defensible financial metrics — and then proves it, mathematically.

> *"RayCtify doesn't just flag bias. It diagnoses it, heals it, stress-tests it, establishes a ground-truth baseline against it, and trains future models to never repeat it."*

### What Makes RayCtify Different

Unlike point-solution fairness checkers, RayCtify operates across a **five-pillar lifecycle** — from raw model ingestion all the way to adversarial dataset generation for future model training. Every stage is traceable, auditor-ready, and built for enterprise deployment with zero data retention.

---

## 🏛️ The 5-Pillar Architecture

### Pillar I — 🔬 The Interceptor *(Model Healing)*

The entry point of the RayCtify pipeline. The Interceptor ingests serialized institutional models in `.pkl`, `.onnx`, and `.pmml` formats via a secure deserialization layer, with no data written to disk at any stage.

**What it does:**

- Maps the full feature schema of the ingested model
- Detects sensitive demographic parameters (race, gender, zip code proxies, national origin, etc.)
- Wraps the original model in the `RayCtifiedWrapper` — a transparent proxy layer
- Mathematically **zeroes out the weights** of all identified illegal proxy variables
- Exports the "healed" model in a clean, auditable format

The result is a production-ready model that has been surgically corrected, with a full audit trail of exactly which parameters were neutralized and why.

---

### Pillar II — 🔍 The Model Auditor *(Granular Introspection)*

Designed for **single-applicant micro-analysis**, the Model Auditor gives compliance officers and data scientists an unambiguous view into exactly how the AI reached its decision.

**Key capabilities:**

- **High-Precision Normalization** — Dynamically extracts the internal coefficients of the model and forces them into a perfect 100% relative influence breakdown, so every factor's contribution is immediately legible.
- **True-Sign Preservation** — Accurately renders the push/pull polarity of each decision factor. An auditor can see, for example, that `DTI` dragged the approval score down (−) while `income_to_debt_ratio` pushed it up (+), cleanly separating financial reality from demographic noise.
- **Demographic Isolation** — Highlights the exact delta between what the base model would have scored and what the RayCtified model scores for the same applicant.

---

### Pillar III — ⚔️ The Arena *(Batch Stress Testing)*

Where individual auditing ends, institutional-scale evaluation begins. The Arena evaluates hundreds of applicant records **simultaneously**, pitting the original biased model directly against its RayCtified counterpart.

**Key capabilities:**

- Ingests bulk applicant datasets and runs parallel inference on both models
- Calculates an explicit **"Bias Penalty" delta score** for each applicant — a precise, numerical representation of how much the base model artificially suppressed approval probability for that individual
- Aggregates results by demographic cohort, generating the kind of statistically rigorous output that satisfies CFPB, OCC, and internal legal review
- Provides side-by-side approval rate comparisons that are Wall Street presentation-ready

---

### Pillar IV — 📐 The Reference Model *(Ground Truth Baseline)*

Because even a RayCtified AI model can drift in subtle, unpredictable ways, RayCtify includes a mathematically pristine **Reference Engine** built on the `REFERENCE_MODEL_SCHEMA`.

This schema explicitly excludes all demographic variables and uses only **9 pristine financial factors** (credit score, income, DTI, employment history, and related signals) to produce a classical, rules-based loan scoring output.

**Why this matters:**

The Reference Model answers the auditor's most fundamental question: *"What would a standard, purely mathematical banking formula say about this applicant?"* Any significant deviation between the AI's output and the Reference Model's output is a quantified signal of **algorithmic drift** — the kind of unexplained divergence that regulators flag during examination.

---

### Pillar V — 💉 The Vaccine *(Adversarial Dataset Generation)*

The Vaccine generator closes the loop on the entire auditing lifecycle. Once a model's vulnerabilities have been fully exposed through Pillars I–IV, the Vaccine creates the cure.

**What it generates:**

- **Demographically Neutralized Batches** — Synthetic datasets where sensitive attributes are balanced and de-correlated from financial outcomes, suitable for retraining
- **Adversarial Edge Cases** — Deliberately crafted applicant profiles designed to probe and stress-test model boundaries, exposing latent proxy dependencies before they reach production
- **Safe Augmentation Sets** — Clean, policy-compliant datasets ready to be fed back to data-science teams as training signal

The Vaccine effectively **inoculates future models** against proxy bias before they are ever trained, breaking the cycle at the source.

---

## 🛡️ Enterprise Features

### Institutional Guardrails

RayCtify enforces hard, non-negotiable banking policies through vectorized Pandas logic that intercepts the prediction pipeline before output is returned. These guardrails operate safely across large batch jobs with no performance penalty.

- Automatically rejects any applicant with a credit score below **500** (deep subprime threshold), regardless of the AI model's computed probability
- Configurable policy thresholds map to internal credit policy documents, providing a clear audit chain between code and compliance documentation

### Standardized Telemetry

To ensure outputs are compatible with regulatory submissions and internal risk dashboards:

- DTI is standardized as `dti_ratio` with a **20% baseline weight**, enforced across all scoring computations
- All feature names are normalized to an industry-standard schema before any inference is run, guaranteeing consistent reporting across model versions and vendors

### Zero-Retention In-Memory Processing

No institutional IP or personally identifiable information (PII) is ever written to disk, logged to application storage, or retained in any server-side cache. All processing occurs entirely in-memory within ephemeral Cloud Run containers that are destroyed after each request. See the [Security Policy](#-security--data-privacy) for full details.

## 🔒 Security & Data Privacy

RayCtify was engineered from the ground up with institutional data governance requirements in mind.

### Zero-Retention In-Memory Processing

All model artifacts, applicant records, and inference outputs are processed **exclusively in the memory of ephemeral Google Cloud Run containers**. Specifically:

- No model files (`.pkl`, `.onnx`, `.pmml`) are written to disk or persisted in cloud storage
- No applicant PII (names, SSNs, addresses, demographic attributes) is logged, stored, or transmitted to any third-party service
- Each Cloud Run container instance is destroyed after completing its request lifecycle, leaving no residual data
- Application logs are scoped to operational telemetry only (latency, status codes) and contain no user or model data

### Institutional IP Protection

Uploaded model files represent proprietary intellectual property. RayCtify's architecture ensures that:

- Model weights and architecture details are **never retained** beyond the duration of a single API request
- The `RayCtifiedWrapper` outputs a healed model for client download; no copy is stored server-side
- All inter-service communication is encrypted in transit via TLS 1.3

### Compliance Posture

RayCtify's design is aligned with the requirements of the **Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)**, **Fair Housing Act (FHA)**, and **CFPB supervisory guidance** on algorithmic fairness. The Bias Penalty reports generated by The Arena are structured to support regulatory examination responses.
